## How to play the game:

- First click the "rules" button to view the rules of the game and what the various modes are about.
- The game starts at default mode "Normal", press any arrowkeys to start the game. The game will be played only with the arrowkeys to direct the snake to eat the food. In this mode, you will gain 1 point for each food eaten.
- If the game is too easy, you can try hard mode, the speed is alot faster, and you will gain 3 points for each food eaten.
- Still too easy? Try hardcore mode, the speed is slightly faster and obstacles will spawn in random areas of the map. You will gain 5 points for each food eaten.

## Deployment

The game is deployed on GitHub Pages, and you can play the game here:

## Future Features

- Create a leaderboard for the game.
- Create more unique game featues such as an extra life/ invulnerability.
- Create a tier list for different food that will increase your score and not just dependent on the game mode, however these food will only be available for a limited amount of time.
